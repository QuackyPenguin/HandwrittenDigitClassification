# HandwrittenDigitClassification
Program that uses keras library to create a model that classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 
model.py loads the dataset, and creates the model which is first trained on a part of it
In the end it is tested and prints the accuracy of it and saves the model. 
The file sample_image_prediction.py can be used to predict a digit written in a sample image using the saved model.
